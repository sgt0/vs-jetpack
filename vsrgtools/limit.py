    Performs a soft-limiting between two clips to limit the difference of filtering while avoiding artifacts.

    Args:
        flt: Filtered clip.
        src: Source clip.
        ref: Reference clip, to compute the weight to be applied on filtering diff.
        dark_thr: Threshold (8-bit scale) to limit dark filtering diff.
        bright_thr: Threshold (8-bit scale) to limit bright filtering diff.
